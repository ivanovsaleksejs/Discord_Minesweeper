## Discord Minesweeper

Generates a Minesweeper grid that can be pasted into Discord channel. Each cell is a number, a mine (`@` symbol) or a space, if no mines around.

### How to play

Solve by clicking on cells. To reset, just switch to another channer and then switch back.

### How to generate grid

Download the Discord_Minesweeper.js and run `node Discord_Minesweeper.js`. Copy the output and paste into Discord channel.

### Size of a grid

It seems that Discord has a limit of 99 spoilers per message. Can probably be solved by splitting the grid in several messages.
